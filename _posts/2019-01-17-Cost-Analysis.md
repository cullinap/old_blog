# Cost Analysis Project

The purpose of this project was to take two inputs, cost data and manhour data and sort it for weekly reports instead of re-creating a new spreadsheet each week. This enabled me to quickly report and track progress on various construction projects and analyze week over week burn on manhours, cost, and subsequently progress.
